**Is the order a new tab page?**

![Chino would be proud.](/img/sample.png?raw=true)

Tippy is an alternate new tab page for Google Chrome that pulls wonderful
images from the top rankings of [Pixiv](http://www.pixiv.com) to surprise and
delight with every `Cmd-T`, or `Ctrl-T` if you're a plebeian. Tippy is
"fully responsive," written with five different preprocessors, and takes full
advantage of vendor prefixes. It is guaranteed to increase market penetration
for you and your significant others. Let's have cafe daydreams.

Currently, Tippy requires that you be on the
[Chrome Dev Channel](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) for
certain features (recently closed tabs) to work. Sorry about that.

Tippy is a work in progress; if you see any problems, please report an issue
or [let me know directly](https://twitter.com/shinocence)! Don't forget to
enable developer mode in Chrome if you want to help contribute. Or if you just
want to try it out, grab it [here](http://rabuko.me/files/owaranai.zip).
